#### CS 4644 â€“ LeafCrunch: Surveying ML Methods on LeafSnap
Richard Koulen, Jade Spooner, Priya Nayak, Peter Wang

#### Abstract
Image classification is a classic problem, and architectures are soon going to have to contend with dense classification taxonomies. We explore this problem through tree leaf classification with the LeafSnap dataset. We attempted 3 different deep learning methodologies used in the past for image identification: Convolutional Neural Networks, Autoencoders, and Vision Transformers. Our CNN model, DarkLeafNet, resulted in a top-1 accuracy of 80.34\% and a top-5 accuracy of 95.61\%. The SWin ViT-Tiny architecture, which we fine-tuned on LeafSnap data, achieved a top-1 accuracy of 92.48\% and a top-5 of 99.66\%. Both of these methods outperformed the original LeafSnap approach, and we found that a dense taxonomy is not specifically problematic for these approaches, requiring at best, slightly more expressivity.
